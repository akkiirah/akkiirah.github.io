                            <h3>Apprenticeship as Game and Multimedia developer at SRH</h3>                    
                            <p>
                                In 2018, after I've finished school, 
                                I went to SRH University in Stuttgart Germany to start 
                                my education on Game and Multimedia developement.
                                This training took the form of a mainly theoretical apprenticeship.
                                The lessions included stuff like, Web Development with HTML, CSS, JavaScript
                                and NodeJS and Vue and SQL for the backend.
                                Also C# with the MonoGame Framework and Unity3D for Game programming.
                                This was the time I made the two games "Speed for Needs" and "Quarx" 
                                which were created for exams and whose trailers can be found on the start page.
                                I've also started working on a simple top down Aircraft shooter written in C# 
                                to harden my skills with that language and programming in general.
                                This Project however was paused indefinitely due to time constraints.
                                After two years I've graduated as "State certified Game- and Multimedia developer".
                                I've learned alot during that time but it was time for more practical experience.
